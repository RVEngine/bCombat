DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------

bCombat main objective is to achieve both a more effective and human-alike AI.
It features an unique ecosystem, including a complex morale system, event aware AI behaviour and all-around AI enhancements.

Core features include:

+   Full-featured morale system: morale affects both AI behaviour and combat effectiveness. AI will act aggressively or passively depending on circumstances.
+   Event driven AI behaviour: any environmental events such as enemies inbound, heard gunfire, suppressive fire, nearby explosions and ricochets or casualties have an effect on AI behaviour.
+   Real-time suppression effects: bCombat relies on (included) bDetect framework for accessing real-time ballistic information on any bullets flying by on the battlefield.
+   Automatic, gunfire aware stance handling: units will crouch, sprint or go prone according to situation
+   Enhanced fire & movement routines

Optional (toggleable) experimental features include, as of v0.14:

+   Custom move to cover behaviour
+   Aggressive return fire / fire back behaviour
+   Mutual covering behaviour
+   Suppressive fire behaviour
+   Specialized suppressive / overwatch behaviour
+   Custom fleeing behaviour
+   Surrendering behaviour
+   CQB enhancements
+   Enhanced hearing: units do hear gunfire and explosions at distance
+   Investigate behaviour: units alerted by casualties or gunfire may move to nearby places to investigate enemy presence
+   Enhanced grenade throwing: very short to long distance, includes blind throwing over obstacles
+   Automatic formation tightening feature
+   Faster movement feature
+   Friendly fire damage capping
+   And more ...

All this is delivered pre-configured and ready to go, while it can be tweaked at will via its own configuration file (config.sqf).
