=========================================

INTRODUCTION
-----------------------------------------

bCombat is an ArmA 3 infantry AI enhancement mod in form of addon, still under development.
It's currently Single Player. CBA is this only requirement.

+   Download and install latest CBA distribution, get it from here: http://dev-heaven.net/projects/cca/files


INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------

+   Extract the bCombat zip package anywhere.
+   Move "@bcombat" folder from extraction location to your ArmA 3 main folder ( usually: <Your Steam Path>\steamapps\common\Arma 3\ )
+   Move "userconfig" folder from "@bcombat" folder to your ArmA 3 main folder.

	Please doublecheck "bcombat_config.hpp" file exists within the path:

+   Launch ArmA 3 and activate bCombat from "Configure / Expansions" menu.


DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------

bCombat aims to achieve both a more aware and human-alike infantry AI.
It features an unique ecosystem, including an event-driven AI morale / skill system as well as many optional AI enhancements.

Highlights:

+	Morale system driving dynamically AI behavour and skills.
+	AI behaviour is affected by many environmental events (spotted enemies, explosions, bullets whizzling by, ricochets, wounds, casualties, ...).
+	Modular mod architecture: optional features may be toggled on/off or tweaked at will.
+   Reduced (excessive) AI firing accuracy.
+   AI units proactively lay suppressive fire and suffer sensible morale / skill penalty when suppressed.
+   Increased AI survivability: better use of cover, movement and suppressive fire lead to longer firefights. 
+	Player led AI units require far less micro-management on the battlefield.


FEATURES
-----------------------------------------

Core features include:

+   Full-featured morale system: morale affects both AI behaviour and combat effectiveness. AI will act aggressively or passively depending on circumstances.
+   Event driven AI behaviour: any environmental events such as enemies inbound, heard gunfire, suppressive fire, nearby explosions and ricochets or casualties have an effect on AI behaviour.
+   Real-time suppression effects: bCombat relies on (included) bDetect framework for accessing real-time ballistic information on any bullets flying by on the battlefield.
+   Automatic, gunfire aware stance handling: units will crouch, sprint or go prone according to situation
+   Enhanced fire & movement routines

Optional (toggleable) experimental features include, as of v0.15:

+   Custom move to cover behaviour
+   Aggressive return fire / fire back behaviour
+   Mutual covering behaviour
+   Suppressive fire behaviour
+   Specialized suppressive / overwatch behaviour
+   Custom fleeing behaviour
+   Surrendering behaviour
+   CQB enhancements
+   Enhanced hearing: units do hear gunfire and explosions at distance
+   Investigate behaviour: units alerted by casualties or gunfire may move to nearby places to investigate enemy presence
+   Enhanced grenade throwing: very short to long distance, includes blind throwing over obstacles
+   Smoke grenade throwing
+   Automatic formation tightening feature
+   Faster movement feature
+   Friendly fire damage capping
+ 	Custom damage multiplier
+   And more ...

All this is delivered pre-configured and ready to go, while it can be tweaked at will via its own configuration file (config.sqf).
